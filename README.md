Identification and Diagnosis of tumor lesions from Ultrasonography scans utilizing a U-Net style CNN.

This project focuses on the development of a deep learning model for the accurate identification and diagnosis of breast cancer tumors using ultrasound imaging. A U-Net style Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to segment tumor regions from breast ultrasound scans, enabling precise localization and classification of malignant and benign lesions. The architecture leverages an encoder-decoder framework with skip connections to preserve spatial information, enhancing segmentation accuracy. This system aims to assist radiologists in early detection and improve diagnostic reliability, contributing to better patient outcomes in breast cancer screening. Tackling both a classification and segmentation task, the system identifies lesions suspected to be rbeast cancer tumors and classifies it either as a Benign, Malignant or Normal case.
